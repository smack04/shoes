   <h1>Evolution of Shoes</h1>
	<img src="j" alt="evolution_of_shoes">
    <p>“ As someone who has been interested in shoes since childhood and has always had a love for them,  
      Something that I feel is important to know is their history and how they came to be what they came to be what they are
      today and how it all evolved into the shoes and sneaker culture that we have today. From foot coverings created from animal
      hides and leaves to the high tech materials like memory foam in sneakers that we have today and the role that they play in the 
      fashion industry.”</p>
