        <h1>Evolution of Sneaker Culture</h1>
        
        <p>Sneaker culture has evolved from just athletic shoes to a worldwide trend and phenomenon that has impacted so much more than sports, it's impacted music, movies, and especially fashion. 
        It started around the late 19th century when sneakers were first introduced but it was the time period of the 1980s that really made sneaker culture take off. In the late 19th century, around 1860 when rubber-soled shoes were made for tennis and croquet, which were provided for the upper class, as most good footwear was at the time.
        But ultimately, the big band of sneaker culture happened in the 1980s with Nike’s collaboration with Michael Jordan and the release of the Air Jordan 1s in 1985, and it forever revolutionized the culture, especially with
        the shoe getting scrutinized by NBA regulations at first, which led to Nike having to pay fines every time it was worn, but this only added to the allure and mystique of the shoe.

                <p>"This shoe not only sparked controversy but revolutionized sports and made sneakers a symbol of status and self-expression. At the time it was one of the driving
                    forces in the street culture, hip-hop, and basketball; it became one of the most if not the most, iconic shoe of all time."</p>

        <p>Sneaker culture was also greatly influenced by hip-hop and vice versa, by groups like Run-D.M.C with their 1986 hit song “My Adidas”  which lead to an endorsement deal from Adidas, thus furthering the intertwining of music and fashion and cementing sneakers into it as well. As sneaker culture evolved and gained even more popularity, it started to push past its athletic origin. It started to become a staple in everyday life which allowed people to express themselves through their shoes and outfits. And from this, the term “Sneakerhead” came about, which describes someone who collects, trades, and has a great love or obsession over sneakers. Because of this, limited releases, collaboration projects and having a story behind the shoes design, color, or origin started and became a 
            subculture and suddenly it was more than just about shoes, sneakers became a form of art,  a form expression, a way to tell a story, and forever a part of history.  Even today, sneakers are a multibillion-dollar industry with brands like Nike, Jordan, Yeezy, Adidas, New Balance, and so many more. With some even showcased at museums, auctions, and showrooms. Over the years,
            sneakers have become so much more than just shoes. They had become a symbol of culture, expression, trends, art, and even community</p>
